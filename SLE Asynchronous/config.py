# Set game information

# use either username or speedrun.com user ID:
# user = 'y8dwlrgj' or 'timetravelpenguin'
user = 'timetravelpenguin'
game = 'smo'
category = 'any'

# Query should be in form: '?conditionA=1&condintionB=2&conditionC=3'
# For more query filter options, visit:
# https://github.com/speedruncomorg/api/blob/master/version1/runs.md#get-runs
# To query variables, use SLE and find the IDs and use it in the query like so:
# '?var-A=B'
# An example would be: ?var-e8m7em86=5lmoxk01
# e8m7em86 = Platform,	5lmoxk01 = EMU
# So this filters all runs for ONLY EMU Platform runs

# For no filter, query = ''
query = '?emulators=false'
